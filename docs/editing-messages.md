Editing Messages

![](assets/editing-messages/01.png)
 
You can edit messages used in various situations in the Messages tab panel. Some messages are notifications to the submitter of the status of the contact form, such as:

Thank you for your message. It has been sent.
One or more fields have an error. Please check and try again.
Other messages are notifications that there is a validation error in the input field:

This field is required.
This telephone number is invalid.
HTML tags or entities cannot be used in a message, so use plain text only. You’ll see a warning when you insert HTML into a message.

On the other hand, you can use Contact Form 7’s mail-tags in a message. This may be useful when you want to embed a user input into a message, like the following example:

Thanks [your-name], your message has been sent!
This [your-name] is a mail-tag that will be replaced with an actual user input through the your-name field.
